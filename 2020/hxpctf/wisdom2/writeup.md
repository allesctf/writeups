# Description
[Oops, I did it again.](https://2019.ctf.link/internal/challenge/1fef0346-a1de-4aa4-8df9-2d18229c6dbb/) :^)

This is commit # 4232874270015d940a2ba62c113bcf12986a2151 with the attached patch applied. Flag is in /dev/hdb.

Note that the setup of this task is perhaps a bit shaky: If you don’t get a shell prompt within a few seconds after solving the proof of work, something is wrong. Each connection has a time limit of 10 minutes; you may contact us in case this causes problems for you.

# Solution
## Vulnerability
The goal of this task was to find a vulneraility in the latest release of [SerenityOS](http://serenityos.org) in order to read the flag from /dev/hdb. After looking through the code for a while I noticed a vulnerability in the ptrace implementation:
When setting the registers of a thread by calling ptrace(PT\_SETREGS, pid, &regs, 0), eventually the following code is reached (in [Kernel/Ptrace.cpp](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/blob/2dfe5751f35d0067747c6615bf139871cc105fa6/Kernel/Ptrace.cpp#L175)):
```C++
void copy_ptrace_registers_into_kernel_registers(RegisterState& kernel_regs, const PtraceRegisters& ptrace_regs)
{
    kernel_regs.eax = ptrace_regs.eax;
    kernel_regs.ecx = ptrace_regs.ecx;
    kernel_regs.edx = ptrace_regs.edx;
    kernel_regs.ebx = ptrace_regs.ebx;
    kernel_regs.esp = ptrace_regs.esp;
    kernel_regs.ebp = ptrace_regs.ebp;
    kernel_regs.esi = ptrace_regs.esi;
    kernel_regs.edi = ptrace_regs.edi;
    kernel_regs.eip = ptrace_regs.eip;
    kernel_regs.eflags = ptrace_regs.eflags;
}
```
kernel\_regs are the register contents of the ptrace'd process, while ptrace\_regs are the passed-in registers. Note that ptrace\_regs is not checked at all. Can you spot the vulnerability?

If not, maybe [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register) will help you.

The vulnerability is that eflags can be set to arbitrary values. For example, it is possible to set the IOPL bits (bits 12/13) to one, therefore allowing access to I/O Ports (and the interrupt flag) in Ring 3 (userspace).

## Exploitation
There are multiple ways to exploit this vulnerability, but the easiest one is to set IOPL to 3 and then write (or copy ;) an ATA driver to read the flag directly from the IDE drive (using ATA PIO mode). Note that it is also possible to gain root privileges by writing to the main drive (just overwrite a setuid binary or change the owner/mode of your own binary).  
Fortunately, simple ATA PIO drivers already exist and I decided to just use [this one](https://github.com/dhavalhirdhav/LearnOS/blob/fe764387c9f01bf67937adac13daace909e4093e/drivers/ata/ata.c).  
The exploit can be found [here](https://github.com/allesctf/writeups/blob/master/2020/hxpctf/wisdom2/exploit.c).

## Fix
I recommend to always clear the IOPL bits and to always set the interrupt flag. If the nested task flag is not used in SerenityOS, it should also be cleared.  
Also note that the same vulnerability is present in [sigreturn](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/blob/2dfe5751f35d0067747c6615bf139871cc105fa6/Kernel/Syscalls/sigaction.cpp#L112).
